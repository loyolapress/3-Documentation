#published

### Summary and requirements

A user dashboard can be published to other users using the same center. We all primarily use Classic Center, so most people are compatible.

User who will publish the dashboard also needs to have the Publish Dashboards permission attached to their role. This permission can be added temporarily to a specific user to allow the publication, then removed afterward.

### Instructions

1. Log into the user account with the dashboard you want to publish.
2. If permission is enabled, there will be a PUBLISH DASHBOARD option available in the Settings portal. Click the link.

3. Give the dashboard a name, id (optional), and Notes (optional). _The name here is just for managing later and will never really be seen or used otherwise._

4. Select the roles you are publishing to. Check the OVERRIDE EXISTING USERâ€™S SETTINGS only if this role has no other users or those users are ok with losing their own personalized dashboard.
5. Click into the APPLY TO TABS subtab. Select which tabs to publish (most likely all of them). MODE is used to determine whether the users affected will be able to edit/personalize the dashboard further after you give it to them.
6. Click Save.

_Original note from SQW:_

You can publish their dashboards to other users within the same center. If the users are sharing the Accounting Center for instance, we can publish (or save) the dashboard and assign to another role in that center.

There are a few prerequisites to get started, including:

- The role will need to have the permission called Publish Dashboards permission
- Make sure the role share the same role
- Make all the necessary changes for uniformity before publishing

Next steps would be to :

- Publish the dashboard
    - Can assign to new users or existing (will overwrite existing dashboards)
- Make any changes on the individuals dashboard
    - The published dashboard will be a complete mirror image of that saved dashboard; users may want to make changes

Let me know if this answers your question or if you have any additional questions from here!
